        If this is your first time using it, please read these instructions carefully.

        This Xposed module allows you to force applications into fullscreen mode.
        However, this is not a universal solution, meaning it may not be compatible with all apps or games.
        If you experience the module not working, abnormal display, or require specific adaptations,
        you\'ll need to contact the developers of the app or game directly.
        Reporting these issues to me will not lead to a resolution.
